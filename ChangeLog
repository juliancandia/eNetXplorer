2020-08-25 Julian Candia <julian.candia@nih.gov> version 1.1.2
        * added mergeObj.R function to merge objects generated with different alphas.
        * added option to save full lambda vs QF information; updated export function accordingly.  
        * added option to create the destination directory recursively.
        * survival time-dependent AUC in Cox models is now calculated using the timeROC package and dependencies (before, the package survivalROC was used). 
        * fixes to time-dependent ROC plots. 
        * updated and improved man pages.
        * extensive update of the vignette to report errata and to discuss parallelization, negative regression slopes, etc.
 
2020-06-14 Julian Candia <julian.candia@nih.gov> version 1.1.1
        * deleted exportClasses() from NAMESPACE to address some Package Check warnings.

2019-09-19 Julian Candia <julian.candia@nih.gov> version 1.1.0
        * added Cox regression (family="cox").
        * added BreastC_Surv.RData dataset for Cox regression.
        * added plots specific to Cox regression: plotKaplanMeier, plotSurvROC.
        * added functionality to save the eNetXplorer object.
        * fixed y-axis label of plotMeasuredVsOOB for categorical models.
        * improved handling of destination directory and file names in export.R and summaryPDF.R 
        * updated and improved man pages.

2019-04-16 Julian Candia <julian.candia@nih.gov> version 1.0.2
	* expanded built-in quality function options for binomial and multinomial models.
        * expanded the Leukemia_miR.RData dataset to include both full and filtered datasets (to ensure data provenance and reproducibility).
        * added error-catching functions, so that if an error happens, results for completed alphas are returned. 
        * added n_lambda_eff to deal with glmnet convergence issues (where glmnet would return solutions for a subset of lambdas).
        * added suppressWarnings() call around arrows() in plotFeatureCaterpillar.R and plotFeatureCaterpillarMultinom.R 
        * added vignette.
        * updated man pages.
        * updated citation.     

2018-06-10 Julian Candia <julian.candia@nih.gov> version 1.0.1
	* added export option for p-value tables. 
	* added progress bar during computation of model predictions.
        * updated references.
        * fixed bug in plot feature heatmap code (issue with sparse pval matrix).
